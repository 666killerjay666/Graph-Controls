# Windows Graph Controls

This is a sub-repo for the [Windows Community Toolkit](https://aka.ms/wct) focused on [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/) providing a set of Helpers and Controls for development on Windows 10 with .NET.

This new library replaces the `Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.UI.Controls.Graph` package; however, it is not backwards compatible nor does it provide all the same features at this time.

If you need similar controls for the Web, please use the [Microsoft Graph Toolkit](https://aka.ms/mgt).

## <a name="supported"></a> Supported SDKs

* Windows 10 18362 (ðŸš§ TODO: Check Lower SDKs)
* `LoginButton` & `PersonView` on Android via [Uno.Graph-Controls](https://aka.ms/wgt-uno) use `Uno.Microsoft.Graph.Controls` package. (ðŸš§ `PeoplePicker` soon!)
* ðŸš§ Coming Soon ðŸš§
  * XAML Islands Sample
  * iOS (Waiting on [MSAL#1378](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/pull/1378) merge should be 4.4.0?)

## <a name="documentation"></a> Getting Started

Before using controls that access [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com), you will need to [register your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) to get a **ClientID**.

> After finishing the initial registration page, you will also need to add an additional redirect URI. Clcik on "Add a Redirect URI" and check the `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient` checkbox on that page. Then click "Save".

### UWP Quick Start

To include the latest preview MyGet package in your Visual Studio environment, open your _Package Sources_ settings from the title-bar search, click the green '+' and change the source following :

`https://dotnet.myget.org/F/uwpcommunitytoolkit/api/v3/index.json`

Give it a name, and then click the `Update` button. Then use the following command on the _Package Manager Console_:

```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.Toolkit.Graph.Controls -IncludePrerelease
```

<!-- TODO: Update instructions later to single PMC line when https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7189 is fixed. -->

Then open your `App.xaml` file and add the following resource:

```xml
<Application
    ...
    xmlns:wgt="using:Microsoft.Toolkit.Graph.Providers">
    <Application.Resources>
        <wgt:InteractiveProvider x:Key="MyProvider" ClientId="YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE" Scopes="User.Read,User.ReadBasic.All,People.Read"/>
    </Application.Resources>
</Application>
```

You can use the `Scopes` property to preemptively request permissions from the user of your app for data your app needs to access from Microsoft Graph.

**That's all you need to get started!**

You can add any of the controls now to your XAML pages like we've done in our [sample](SampleTest/MainPage.xaml).

You can use the `ProviderManager.Instance` to listen to changes in authentication status with the `ProviderUpdated` event or get direct access to the [.NET Graph Beta API](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-dotnet) through `ProviderManager.Instance.GlobalProvider.Graph`, just be sure to check if the `GlobalProvider` has been set first and its `State` is `SignedIn`:

```csharp
var provider = ProviderManager.Instance.GlobalProvider;

if (provider != null && provider.State == ProviderState.SignedIn)
{
    // Do graph call here with provider.Graph...
}
```

### Android Quick Start

Visit the [Uno.Graph-Controls](https://aka.ms/wgt-uno) repo for instructions on using the library with Uno on Android.
